# connect-four
This repository contains a react app of the board game (if it can be called a board game) [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). The game was developed as part of my mobile applicatons class at [ZHAW](https://zhaw.ch).
Shortly after I wrote the first version of this program, I realized that checking for winning solutions was harder than anticipated. Thus, after consulting [Dr. Gerrit Burkert](mailto:bkrt@zhaw.ch)-who inspired and wrote parts of this code- this functional sulotuion was created.
